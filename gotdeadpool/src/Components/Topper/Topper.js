                    <h4>What is this?</h4>
                    <p>Nick's deadpool for Game of Thrones Season 8. You'll need gmail and venmo.</p>

                    <h4>How do I play?</h4>
                    <p>Login using your gmail account and wait for approval.</p>
                    <p>Once approved, you may select 10 characters from a pool of 30.</p>
                    <p>Confirm your deadpool picks and watch Game of Thrones</p>

                    <h4>What are the wagers?</h4>
                    <p>Your wager is $10. More or less will disqualify you from participating.</p>

                    <h4>How do I win?</h4>
                    <p>We will keep track of who <b>DIES</b> up until the final episode. The person with the most characters <b>ALIVE</b> in their deadpool is the winner. </p>

                    <p>For example, Bob has selected Bran Stark, Arya Stark, and Sansa Stark. His friend John chooses Bran Stark, Cersei Lannister, and Jaime Lanniser.</p>
                    <p>Hypothetically, at the end of Episode 5, only Bran and Arya Stark are alive. Bob wins the wager because he has two characters alive.</p>

                    <h4>Is this safe/legal?</h4>
                    <p>When you log in with your gmail account, all the data is passed through google. Google Authentication allows me only your name and email.</p>
                    <p>Totally. Friendly Wagers are legal last I checked (thanks internet)</p>

                    <h4>How do I know who is playing?</h4>
                    <p>There's a handy button that shows all the players who have paid and have deadpools.</p>

                    <h4>Wait, this isn't how a deadpool actually works...</h4>
                    <p>Let's just settle and call this a variant. We do what we want.</p>

                    <h4>Wouldn't this be easier with a google form, or even paper and pen?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, but by participating on this website, you are helping me grow as a web developer.</p>

                    <h4>One last thing, what if TWO players have the same number of characters alive in their dead pool?</h4>
                    <p>The bounty is split!</p>
